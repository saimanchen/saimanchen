    It can be challenging for parents to dress their children, 
    especially during seasons when the weather conditions change
    from day to day. Dressing children in too little or too much 
    clothing can make them feel uncomfortable or, in the worst case, 
    catch a cold. It can also be difficult to get children to cooperate, 
    which can lead to stressful mornings for parents.

    This app is built to help parents of young children dress their kids 
    in a simple and efficient way depending on the weather. The app takes
    into account factors such as temperature and weather conditions like 
    rain, snow, sun, and wind. Depending on the weather, parents are given 
    recommendations for different clothing items in the form of a list.

    'Dress your child' also includes a game to make it more interactive and 
    fun for the children. The entire game is based on a clothing item list, 
    where each item represents a game level.

    The idea is that by turning dressing into a game, parents and children 
    can have a more positive and enjoyable experience together in the mornings.

Unfortunately, I'm unable to show the code here as it belongs to a private <br>
repository within my internship's GitHub organization. But here is a video demo of <br>
its current state: [Dress Your Child](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_I3J_Aw_qQ)
